# Online Doctor System

## Project Description
The **Online Doctor System** is a web-based application designed to predict diseases based on user-input symptoms. The frontend is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, while the backend is powered by **Flask**. The system integrates a **Decision Tree Machine Learning Algorithm** to analyze the symptoms provided by users and predict potential diseases.

## Features
- **User-friendly interface** for inputting symptoms.
- **Real-time disease prediction** based on the input symptoms.
- Backend powered by **Flask** for efficient handling of user requests.
- **Decision Tree Machine Learning Algorithm** for accurate disease prediction.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Decision Tree Algorithm

## How It Works
1. The user inputs their symptoms into the web interface.
2. The system sends the data to the Flask backend.
3. The backend processes the symptoms using the **Decision Tree Algorithm** to predict the disease.
4. The result is returned to the user with a predicted disease or condition.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- **Python** (version 3.x)
- **Flask** (install using `pip install Flask`)
- **scikit-learn** (install using `pip install scikit-learn`)

### Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vidyaipatil/Online-Doctor.git
